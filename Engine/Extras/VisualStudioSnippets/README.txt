Visual Studio Snippets
==================================
These are auto expanding shortcuts you can use in the editor.  To Import them, go to:

TOOLS > Code Snippets Manager > Import

Once you have them imported you can do stuff like the following:

type: uproperty (Tab)

and this will be generated:

/** The MyProperty */
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Game")
float MyProperty;
