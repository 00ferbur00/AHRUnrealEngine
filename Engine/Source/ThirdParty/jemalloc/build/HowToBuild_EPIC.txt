Needs to be built on target machine.  

For Linux:

1) Untar

To build "separate" version:
2s) ./configure --with-mangling --with-jemalloc-prefix=je_$VERSION_ (e.g. je_340_ for 3.4.0)
3s) make
4s) copy files .a files from /lib and .h from /include to ../lib/Linux/separate and ../include/Linux/separate

To build "drop-in" version:

2d) ./configure
3d) make
4d) copy files .a files from /lib and .h from /include to ../lib/Linux/drop-in and ../include/Linux/drop-in

Prefix for "separate" build may be arbitrary (if you don't like suggested scheme), it's there just to make
function names different from standard malloc()/free().

I really need to make a shell script out of that...
