SETTING UP THE TWITCH SDK WITH UNREAL ENGINE
============================================


The Twitch SDK is currently not included with Unreal Engine by default.  This means that the 
TwitchLiveStreaming plugin will not be able to function, and Twitch features will not be available 
in the game or editor.

To use Twitch in your game, you'll need to download it from the Twitch developer website and set it 
up, following the instructions below.  Make sure to read over the evaluation license and the SDK integration
guide on the web site.  While you are free to test your game using the downloaded SDK, Twitch does not permit
you to release a game that uses Twitch features without first signing an agreement with Twitch.

Currently we support version 6.17 of the Twitch SDK.

To install the SDK:

	- Download the 6.17 SDK from the Twitch web site.  https://github.com/twitchtv/sdk-dist
		- Make sure you pull down the correct version of the SDK. (6.17)
		- Also remember to read the Twitch SDK license agreement.

	- Unzip the SDK to the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Twitch/Twitch-6.17/ folder (create the folder if it is missing)

	- Copy the precompiled binary files in the Twitch SDK "lib" folder to a the /Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/Twitch/Twitch-6.17/ folder (create the folder if it is missing)

	- Recompile the engine.  The TwitchLiveStreaming plugin will see the SDK files, and activate support for Twitch broadcasting in the game and editor.
	
	- See the Unreal Engine manual for more about using the built-in Twitch integration for broadcasting your game or editor sessions
	

That's it!  Have fun!
